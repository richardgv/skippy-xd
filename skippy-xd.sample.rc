#
# - File Syntax:
#   Comments must be on their own seperate lines that start with a #
#   You cannot append # comment after a settings line or a section header
#
# - colors can be anything XAllocNamedColor can handle
#   (like "black" or "#000000")
#
# - fonts are Xft font descriptions
#
# - booleans are "true" or anything but "true" (-> false)
#
# - opacity is an integer in the range of 0-255
#
# - brightness is a floating point number (with 0.0 as neutral)
#
# - Picture specification:
#   [WIDTHxHEIGHT] [orig|scale|scalek|tile] [left|mid|right] [left|mid|right]
#   [COLOR|#FFFFFFFF] [PATH]
#
# - keysUp, keysDown, keysLeft, keysRight:
#   selects the window in the direction compared to the current selected window,
#   without wrapping
#
# - keysPrev, keysNext:
#   selects window previous or next to current one, in up->down, left->right
#   ordering, wrapping per column and per row
#   
#   Examples:
#   background = 500x400 tile right mid #FF0000 /home/richard/screenshots/256.png
#   background = orig mid mid #FF000080
#
# - [bindings] for miwMouse[1,2,3] can bind to "no" (do nothing), "focus"
#   (focus to window), "iconify", "shade-ewmh" (toggle window shade state),
#   "close-icccm" (close window with ICCCM method), "close-ewmh" (close
#   window with EWMH method), or "destroy" (forcefully destroy the window),
#   "keysPrev" to focus on previous window, "keysNext" to focus on next window.
#
# - [bindings] key* = is a list of valid XWindows KeySym identifiers, case
#   sensitive and <space> seperated list. Run the program 'xev' to find them.
#
# - [bindings] modifierKeyMasks* = is a list of valid XWindows modifier key
#   bitmask identifiers, as defined in the /usr/include/X11/X.h header file.
