0.5.1~hg -- "No codename" (23 Dec 2011)
 - Correctly auto-detect 32 or 64-bit system and compile appropriately.
 - Removed X11-based hotkey activation code (skippy now displays once on
   startup then quits, instead of waiting to be activated).
 - Updated config loading code (and sample config file) accordingly.
 - Skippy config is now loaded from ~/.config/skippy-xd/skippy-xd.rc
 - Did some code cleanup (following the boy-scout rule, and just helping 
   myself to grok it).
 - Rework triggering code so that activation can be triggered by command 
   rather than just a hotkey. Better to use DE's global hotkeys.
 - Add command-line targets for named-pipe based ipc.
   Start Daemon: skippy-xd --start-daemon
   Stop Daemon: skippy-xd --stop-daemon (daemon must be running)
   Activate Window Picker: skippy-xd --activate-window-picker (daemon must be
   running)
 - If skippy-xd is run with no arguments, the window picker is activated once, 
   then the program closes.

0.5.0 -- "Damage, Inc." (19 May 2004)
 - 'Lazy transparency' mode: let xcompmgr take care of alpha-blending the
   mini-windows.
 - Tooltip can have drop-shadow text, and can be translucent
 - Read config from ~/.skippy-xd.rc since the configuration options have
   changed
 - Branched from 'regular' skippy, switched from Imlib2 to XRender
   rendering, removed the old window snapshot code and replaced it with
   XComposite / XDamage stuff
